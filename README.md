## Projects
### A Behavioral Experiment on Student Attendance
### 🧠 *Objective:*

To determine whether sending *incentive-based email reminders* increases attendance at student-led events.

### 🧪 *Experiment Design:*

| Component                  | Description                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Sample*                 | 48 pre-registered students for internal events at UCSD Rady School |
| *Randomization*          | Done at the individual level using a Python script                 |
| *Treatment Group*        | Received a reminder email 24–48 hours before the event             |
| *Control Group*          | Received no reminder                                               |
| *Tracking*               | Attendance was measured using event sign-in records                |
| *Incentives Highlighted* | Free food 🍔, networking 🤝, insider insights 💡                   |

📩 Sample Reminder Email:
“Just a reminder: Don’t miss tonight’s event! ✅ Free food, ✅ Meet UCSD’s supply chain leader, ✅ Insider insights — it’s all happening at 5:15 PM in Room 3N128!”

### 📊 *Statistical Analysis & Results:*

#### ✅ T-Test

•⁠  ⁠*T-statistic*: -2.8284
•⁠  ⁠*P-value: 0.0076 (statistically significant*)
•⁠  ⁠*Interpretation*: Attendance significantly increased with reminders

#### 📏 Cohen’s d

•⁠  ⁠*Effect Size: 0.82 (large*)
•⁠  ⁠*Interpretation*: Reminders had a strong real-world impact

#### 🔍 Chi-Square Test

•⁠  ⁠*Result*: Observed vs. expected attendance showed significant differences
•⁠  ⁠*Interpretation*: Reminder group had a clearly higher turnout

### 📌 *Key Results:*

| Metric              | Control Group | Treatment Group | Impact |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------ |
| *Attendance Rate* | 58.3%         | 91.6%           | +33.3% |
| *No-Show Rate*    | 41.6%         | 8.3%            | −33.3% |

### 💡 *Takeaways:*

•⁠  ⁠Simple behavioral nudges can drive *measurable behavioral change*
•⁠  ⁠Personalization + timely delivery (24–48 hours before) enhances effectiveness
•⁠  ⁠Highlighting tangible incentives (e.g., free food) improves engagement


Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.youtube.com/)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
